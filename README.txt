Basic Idea:
You will write the AI logic for a Settlers of Catan game. At some point the 4 of us will get together and have a tournament to determine who will be sacrificed at the altar. 


Description of Folders:
 - Games: 	Contains all game log files. Files are named using the datetime when the file was created.
 - Players: 	All player scripts must be contained here. The class must be named BasePlayer.
 - Reference: 	Supporting documentation for development will be located here including bug reporting.
 - Resources: 	Persistent data needed to setup the game will be stored here.
 - Source: 	Contains all code excluding player AIs. Feel free to inspect.
 - UnitTests:	Created to contain unit tests for each module but importing cross folder was a pain in the ass so it's empty.
